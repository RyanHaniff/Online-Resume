    <h2><u>Profile</u></h2>
    <p>
      A highly motivated computer science graduate from Concordia University
      with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, Algorithms,
      Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. As a current developer
      at NanoStride AI, Concordia University's esteemed AI & Robotics Club, I
      apply my expertise in AI to implement speech recognition models. Through
      my work at NanoStride, I have gained invaluable hands-on experience in
      developing and implementing programming solutions. Committed to continuous
      learning, I actively participate in hackathons to explore new programming
      languages and tools, further expanding my skill set.

    <h2><u>Education</u></h2>
    <h3>Bachelor in Computer Science - Concordia University</h3>
    <h4>September 2020 - April 2023</h4>
    <hr />

    <h2><u>Work Experience</u></h2>
    <h3>Software Developer - NanoStride AI</h3>
    <p>
      Developed and trained an NLP model using Machine Learning to accurately
      analyze and interpret human language. Optimized the model by scraping
      questions and answers from Concordia's website and constructing a MySQL
      database with the extracted data.

    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
    <h3>ConUHacks 2023 Participant</h3>
    <p>
      Developed an interactive augmented reality aircraft on Android using Unity
      AR. Troubleshoot and fixed bugs and issues in the backend to ensure smooth
      operation of the application.

    <h3>Firefighting cost prediction with tree-based models</h3>
    <p>
      Firefighting is one of the most cost-demanding domains of the public
      safety sector in terms of after-damage and preventive measures.
      Nonetheless, it is a fundamental public service and keeping track of its
      cost can benefit both the firefighters working at the heart of the action
      and the government bodies which manage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in this project, we answer the following research questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Is it possible to predict the notional cost of firefighting operations
        using tree-based models?
      </li>
      <li>Which tree-based model provides the best prediction accuracy?</li>
      <li>
        What features correlate more or less strongly with the notional cost?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Identifying Facial Expressions</h3>
    <p>
      Created a model for facial expression recognition with Convolutional
      Neural Networks (CNNs). Simulated a CNN-based classifier with TensorFlow
      and implemented cross-validation and cross-database validation to ensure
      accurate results

    <h3>PolyHacks 2022 Participant</h3>
    <p>
      Designed and developed an alarm clock that challenges users to play a
      random game from a curated collection before allowing them to turn it off.

    <h3>C++ Implementation of Domination (Risk Board Game)</h3>
    <p>
      Implemented player functionality for the "Risk" board game in C++. Five
      player types were implemented: Human, Aggressive, Benevolent, Neutral, and
      Cheater, each with unique behaviours. Ensured that all player types
      interacted correctly based on the project guidelines.
